# Timed Quiz Homework

## Task

In this exercise, we were tasked with creating a quiz featuring multiple-choice questions about Javascript. The quiz needs to feature a timer that counts down. When questions are answered incorrectly a time subtractor penalty is applied to the timer. When all the questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0 then the game is over. At that point the user may submit their initials into a leaderboard that also retains their score.


## Process

To save time so that I could put my focus on the Javascripting portion of this exercise, I used the reference gif from the assigment materials as a basis for the layout and questions:
